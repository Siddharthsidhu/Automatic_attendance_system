# Automatic_attendance_system


The attendance system based on face recognition using LBPH and OpenCV is a real-world attendance system
developed in Python that utilizes LBPH Face recognizer for training the data and Haar cascade classifier for detection of faces.
It is ideal for schools, colleges and workplaces as it eliminates manual attendance-taking, reduces errors, and provides real-time tracking.
